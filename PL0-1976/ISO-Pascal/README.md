# ISO Pascal PL/0 Compiler-Interpreter system
**PL/0** compiler and **PL/0 machine** interpreter system written in **ISO Pascal**. The **CDC Pascal 3.4** system source code, was adapted to **ISO Pascal**. 

**PL/0 EBNF Grammar:**
```
program    = block "." .
block      = [ "CONST" ident "=" number { "," ident "=" number } ";" ]
             [ "VAR" ident { "," ident } ";" ]
             { "PROCEDURE" ident ";" block ";" } statement .
statement  = [ ident ":=" expression | "CALL" ident |
             "BEGIN" statement { ";" statement } "END" |
             "IF" condition "THEN" statement |
             "WHILE" condition "DO" statement ] .
condition  = "ODD" expression |
             expression ( "=" | "#" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" ) expression .
expression = [ "+" | "-" ] term { ( "+" | "-" ) term } .
term       = factor { ( "*" | "/" ) factor } .
factor     = ident | number | "(" expression ")" .
```

**Free Pascal compilation**
```
fpc -Miso pl0.pas
```

**Execution**
```
pl0 < program-file
```
